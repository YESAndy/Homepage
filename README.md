## About Me

Hi, I am Weijia Cai!

I am currently a Master student majoring in Civil Engineering in Carnegie Mellon University. I am a member of Spatiotemporal Workflows and Resilient Management Laboratory (SWARM Lab) under the supervision of Dr. Pingbo Tang, who is an associate professor in CMU. I completed my Bachelor in Geological Engineering in Jilin University, China.

My research interests is the automation of construction processing, computer vision and machine learning. I believe the rich multi-modal information generated from all phases of construction will enable researchers to explore a better way to automate workflow in civil engineering.
